            <p>Becoming a mother was the most profound experience of my life. I am incredibly blessed and thankful to have created such a beautiful and loving family with my lifelong partner, my husband. Together we have two beautiful young girls who inspire us to be the best versions of ourselves.</p>

            <p>Physical fitness is a profound aspect of my daily life. My fitness activities keep me healthy, physically and mentally. If I am not weight training at 5am, I am either running, doing pilates, martial arts, or competing in Spartan races! Fitness is integrated into my personal life, and my family life. Our family enjoys being active together and I instill this in my kids through fun activities.</p>

            <p>Nature is sacred to me and connects me to my individual self. At any opportunity, I am running in nature or exploring the natural world with my family to reconnect to my innerself and recharge my soul. </p>
